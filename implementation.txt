About our program:

Our program is implemented in python and windows. In this program, we made file system and its directory structure is single level directory. All data of file system is placed in one txt file. We used paging in memory management. 
There are 1000 pages of 500 bytes each (500,000 bytes). Beneath the data part is the page table which has each record of 200 bytes and maximum number of records are 1000 (reserved: 200,000 bytes, offset: 500,000). There is a table which determines which page is free and which is not (using flags 0 and 1). In this table each record is of 20 bytes. At the end of the file there is directory information. Each record is of 200 bytes in directory structure and there is no limit on number of directories. But there is a limit on files that can be created since there are limited number of pages. So, at maximum 1000 files can be created. File and directory name can be of 50 characters at maximum.
User would see operations that are mapped with numbers. User will enter number for desired operation and system will ask for different information and corresponding response will be given to the user. To create file user must have to go in some directory. If user is not in any directory yet then file will not be created and message will be shown.
